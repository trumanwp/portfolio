      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Adam Bowie, a student currently in my 2nd year studying
        Computing Science at Glasgow Caledonian University. I have created this
        basic portfolio website using the knowledge I have learned so far in my
        course and in my own self-study to showcase projects that I have worked
        on in my spare time and display my current knowledge and understanding
        in different programming languages!

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        With multiple years of experience within IT, I am looking to transition
        my career into software development. I first started self teaching
        myself python during lockdown, and decided to go to university to commit
        more time towards learning the ins and outs of software development.

        <h3>An analysis of the FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, I have used publicly available data regarding the
          FTSE 100, and highlighted the most successful companies within. I have
          also included an interactive section where the user can "invest" an
          amount of money and the program will return exactly how much money
          they would have made over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project makes use of Python, as well as the pandas and mathdotlib
          libraries.
